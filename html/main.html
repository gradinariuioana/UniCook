	<section class="scris"><h2>Introduction:</h2><p>The start of university comes with lots of worries, so let's not allow cooking to be one of them. Amaze your friends with these cheap and easy, simple-to-make student recipes that will surely save you from those boring sandwiches.</p>
	<p>Though it may seem hard at first (And believe me, I know how powerful laziness can be), eating a meal that's cooked by you tastes way better than the lame pizza you could've ordered.</p>
	<p>So stop holding youself back, put your apron on and let's start cooking!</p>
